Since the Eulerian discrete points (in yellow) are in the same $x_1,x_2$ points, they are aligned across the planes, meaning that the computation of the partial derivative $\pdv {}{x_3}$ in the Lagrangian axis will be computable from plane to plane even if the distance between the planes varies due to the movement of the coupled fluid element in $x_3$.
